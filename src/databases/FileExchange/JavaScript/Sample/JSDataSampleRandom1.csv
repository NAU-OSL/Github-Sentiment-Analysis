If a student focuses on learning a particular stack, they cannot focus on their users needs.
If students are told that the primary objective for the week is to try out a new stack, then the whole week feels utterly contrived - a hurdle, preventing them from actually beginning to learn the technologies that they want to learn."

"@ericelliott, would it be better to use server.get instead of server.use?
I am thinking that if we apply server.use to the resulting handler function, then the resulting handler would prematurely render before the remaining middleware has been applied to the req, res objects. This would only be a problem if global middleware for some reason is declared after this server.use statement, so its more of an edge case.
So maybe this?
server.get('/profile', createHandler({
  requiresFeature: 'profile',
  handler: (req, res) => {
    return app.render(req, res, '/profile', req.query)
  }
));
But I could be missing something, a reason why you used server.use on purpose?"

We have currently case 3 implemented. We will not implement case 1. Instead, there will be a filter where you can see only posts of your followed users.

"check the history package docs. they're short. basically u do: const history = createMemoryHistory() and now u have the object, and then once u pass it to RFR, u no longer worry about it.
I think the answer ur looking for is this:
when using persist, u will already have a history, and so it might break RFR which needs a separate history object to start. in short, and unfortunately, it's sounding like we must finish hydrating from persist, then grab the previous history and put it into the external history object which RFR will continue to use under the hood.
this may require some more work under the hood to automate this unfortunately. at least for Native. Cuz here's the thing: web likely worked cuz there is no history.entries array, as the browser doesn't maintain it for u (or u would have access to other people's history). So that's why people got it to work on web. But on native, we are making use of the history so u can back out of ur entire history.entries. In which case we have the problem i just described. It's solveable, tho likely not supported yet.
I'd build this without persist until the end. I need help by the way. If u wanna add it sooner than later I can make it painless. Otherwise, it's just a little while longer until the RN revisit as you know.
But thanks to bringing this to my attention. This is a problem i gotta solve. I used to use redux-storage, but when i built RFR didnt use storage (which is similar to persist). So i wasnt aware of these problems.

to implement this, we basically need RFR to wait internally until persist is loaded (perhaps by listening directly to its dispatch actions). Then when we receive it, we push the entries on to the internal secondary memory history object we sync to.
Lastly, in userland, we need a way to signal when we're doing deep linking and when we're not. If we are doing deep-linking, we should just clear the history entries in both persist/redux + the memory history, and just start fresh. It doesnt need to be that way though. That's probably just what's most commonly expected. It could also just function like any other new route visited: it's pushed on the end of the history entries array."

"So, I am testing this amazing new feature right now (love it! 💚) and have to say it feels very smooth – it's great that you managed to fit the cropping tool into the size of the create-post-card! 😍
But there's an issue we probably still need to think about... When I crop an image like this:

Here's what I see on the post page:

While I would of course expect to see the image just as I cropped it.
I think right now we have hard-coded a max-height for images because we wanted to avoid suuuperlong images that would force you to scroll down three screens to reach the post content. And I still think we should limit the height of images somewhat to avoid that exact problem, although we could probably give quite a bit more flexibility.
Does the cropping tool allow us to restrict the aspect ratio to a certain range? That would be ideal because we have a fixed width and could then limit the height implicitly by only allowing certain aspect ratios – thus getting rid of the need for a max-height."

"It feels to my like the learning outcomes of this would be the same as the learning outcomes of week 10 - if UX/UI week is staying in the course. But it makes more sense to me to teach 'founder' skills by doing user testing on a prototype before building anything (like week 10), rather than after building the initial app, and then only using user testing for the next feature.
If we think that these skills need to be part of the taught portion of the course (a slightly contentious issue amongst F&C9), why not amalgamate week 10 & 11 in terms of introducing user testing & client interaction?
UX/UI principles themselves can be peppered throughout the course, as per F&C9's stop go continue."

Why then in file backend/src/schema/types/type/Post.gql, line 19:
pinnedAt: String @cypher(
      statement: ""MATCH (this)<-[pinned:PINNED]-(:User) WHERE NOT this.deleted = true AND NOT this.disabled = true RETURN pinned.createdAt""
    )

In my eyes it is a kind of code quality if we are as good as specific we can be. That’s why we are writing test to nail the things more down, as an example.
For sure at the moment only users can pin posts. But that only users can do something is true  for a lot of things. Only users can emote to posts, but we query for the label User as well like in file ""backend/src/schema/resolvers/posts.js“, line 315:
        emotionsCount: '<-[related:EMOTED]-(:User)',

I thing we should just decide if we want to be as specific as possible or as free as possible …
In my eyes more specific tracks down more possible errors …"

"great thanks @Tirokk, almost all if not all stem from the use of the Editor, which leverages tiptap
This is also failing the cypress tests because of the validations we have added this morning. for some reason it is sending an empty string to the backend, instead of sending the text.
""After sending the first comment the text in the comment field is not deleted or field is not updated.""

this is what I pointed out this morning and also occurs when one clicks the cancel button, then types something, and then submits a comment or clicks the cancel button again. This is to due with the editor, as it doesn't occur on a ds-input field.

""The comment counter does not count, if I send a comment.""

This is due to the fact that we are just refetching the comments, instead of refetching the entire post, which contains the commentCount attribute. We could go back to refetching the same Post, or maybe have a function that queries for the Post with only the comments and commentCount, but I had difficulty getting this working and commented on the issue above.

""Submit comment button is not disabled, if text is smaller a 3 characters.""

This is because we are not able to validate the Editor in the frontend, our validation schema only works for ds-input fields... we could write our own custom validations though

""Comments appear in the wrong order under the post: Last as the topmost?""

I think this is working for me(as was intended), it has the latest comments at the top

""Comments should be deleted or edited.""

yes, this is a separate ticket

""Mentions with @should be working.""

do you want to move that webpack loader over to this organisation?

I think I'll keep it separate for now, for one because while it was definitely written for Styled Components, I did see a void in general for custom processors of Stylelint, and it could be that there are some use cases for some of the other custom processors, or maybe new cool things like Styled Components will be invented in the future that might want to use it :).
And then I'm also a bit proud and protective of it as it's my first npm module so I think my pride wants to keep it on my page for now :P.
If at some point in the future it for some reason would make a lot of sense to migrate it I'd be open to it, but for now I also see reasons like the above to keep it separate :)."

"Also, I would draw people's attention to this https://vueschool.io/lessons/vuejs-computed-properties?friend=vuejs
where it talks about the benefit of using a computed property over a method, even though in their example, and our use case, they show the same results, is that ""computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies. A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its reactive dependencies have changed. This means as long as message has not changed, multiple access to the reversedMessage computed property will immediately return the previously computed result without having to run the function again."""

If user is not an admin then a permission denied message is displayed which then redirects us to the home page. But sometimes when the server gets multiple api calls, it responds with an error 503, due to which the permission denied message is not displayed.
