"Yeah I totally get what you're saying. A conversation should really be going on prior to merging. This scenario is very very far from ideal.
But leaving it unmerged and then having a conversation about what should have been done after the curriculum has actually been delivered, means that you're always playing catch up and documenting after the fact.
This is what I'm aiming for:

Before a week is delivered, we merge in what is about to be delivered to the students.
During the week, when students, mentors and facilitators think of potential improvements, issues are raised.
During / after the week, every member of FAC is then able and encouraged to comment and discuss as a community, prior to curriculum planning week
During curriculum planning, students divide themselves between the weeks and planning start with each set of mentors looking through an existing backlog of issues."

I like the idea of having the events at the bottom, and the conditionals at the top, for sure.
I just didn't really like to ask @ogerly to change the location of his classes. The reasons, as I stated, are
1)  we haven't agreed as a team that is what we want to do and

"haha I agree! I'm not sure whether it was an issue or not, but there was an issue opened because the navbar header and locale dropdown didn't line up with the login card.
On the alpha, there is no navbar, neither on the log in card, nor on the reset password card, but then there is a link to translate, and a link to go back to the login page.
Also, on the alpha the footer links don't go to separate pages, rather they are popups, so the user can change the language in the log in menu, then when they click on the terms and conditions link, a modal opens translated to their chosen language.
For nitro, we have all of these footer links linked to other pages with a navbar with the logo to get back to login, and a way to translate the text to the chosen language.
I guess the question is do we want to have no navbar on the login and reset password pages and a basic header on the other 6 pages, or leave it like it is in this PR where all 8 pages have a basic header and not worry that it's lined up with the cards on the login/reset password pages. I guess a third option could be to have different alignment for the navbar links based on what goes best with the page the user is on."

I discussed this with @datenbrei and we agreed to do it this way.
To have the menu not updated while it is open we could say:
 @click.prevent=""
          await updateNotifications()
          toggleMenu()
 ""

But then there will be a delay before the menu opens …
I my eyes there is no big possible harm if the open menu sometimes updates after I click on it.
PS: The toggleMenu function is undefined in any method as far I have tried …"

"Yeah and I get that part, and while @ismay might be making a slightly different point than mine, my reason for removing that test was simply that my only way of implementing this in a simple way broke that test, so I deleted it thinking of it as collateral damage of this PR, not because I wanted to delete it but because I ""had to"" (not really I guess, I haven't thought it out yet but it seems like it'd get really ugly writing that code to handle this special case, and the code could possibly be error prone as well and yeah...).
The thing is, in order to prevent all the other cases of the indentation rule breaking we need to put everything on the baseline anyway, so we'd have to somehow implement the stylelint indentation rule ourselves in order to check if before we put it on the baseline whether it has broken our semantics and then somehow put in a purposefully wrongly indented piece of css into stylelint to force it to throw an error or something like that and that get's messy reeaaaalll fast I'm afraid.
That's my side of the story."

"Especially using the media queries (though it is an example in the docs) could be a bit confusing I guess, but yeah, as I'm new to stylelint it was just hard to think of good examples.

Yeah you're right, I think the media queries might make it too complicated. You could just do this:
Wrong
/* stylelint-disable color-named */
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Wrapper = styled.div`
  background-color: red;
`;
Right
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Wrapper = styled.div`
  /* stylelint-disable color-named */
  background-color: red;
`;
Also stylelint supports different types of configuration comments from within the css. So it's probably best to change the  'stylelint-disable' heading to 'Turning rules off from within your CSS', as that's what it's called in the stylelint docs. Also it'd be good to add a link to this section of the stylelint docs: https://stylelint.io/user-guide/configuration/#turning-rules-off-from-within-your-css

It'd be neat to have in here though so no one else submits erroneous issues like I did :).

No worries, issues with the docs are also valid issues! And prs like this are definitely appreciated 👍"

"memoryHistory lives separately -> then you pass it to redux-first router -> then reducers get it -> then stack routers get it.
the main thing from the React Navigation boilerplate (though I turned it off at the top) is that you can wait on the promise with the incoming URL and then render your app once you get that. rather than setting up redux only to have to wait 50 more ms before the incoming URL promise resolves. this avoids unnecessary dispatches.
Basically u dont render anything until the incoming URL and router/redux is setup. Then stacknavigators/routers render from state like nothing just happened. It's tested in iOS.
I didnt get to test Android whether waiting on the incoming URL promise is possible. It wasn't possible in older versions of React Native. but it became possible in 44."

Functional problems still exist, but could be solved by a later issue:

"no really a fan of this change, but it's not really a big deal.
I don't see a justification to add extra let statements, and lines of code.
Also setting propsData to an initial value of an empty object doesn't have the same effect as resetting it to an empty object before every test. I feel like resetting the value is a safer practice so that we don't get any false negative where we think we are testing one thing, but we are not cause propsData is leaking from one it block to another..."
